Modern Image Gallery 

A premium, responsive image gallery built using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript, inspired by modern portfolio templates like Picto and Patrix.
This project allows users to filter images by category, search by image title, and view images in a full-screen modal with title display.

Features

*  Dynamic image rendering using JavaScript objects
*  Case-insensitive search by image title
*  Category-based filtering (Nature, Travel, Food, People, etc.)
*  Filter and search work together seamlessly
*  Fully responsive layout (Desktop, Tablet, Mobile)
*  Modern premium UI with gradients and hover effects

Tech Stack

* HTML5 – Structure
* CSS3 – Styling (Flexbox & Grid)
* JavaScript (Vanilla) – Logic & DOM manipulation

 How It Works

1. Images are stored in a JavaScript array of objects.
2. Gallery renders dynamically from this data.
3. Filter buttons display images by category.
4. Search input filters images by title.
5. Clicking an image opens a full-screen preview modal.
6. Users can close the preview to return to the gallery.
